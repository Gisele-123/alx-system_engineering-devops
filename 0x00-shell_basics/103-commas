Here's a possible command that meets the requirements:
ls -1A | sed -E 's/^([^0-9A-Za-z\/]*)(.*)(\/?)$/\2\3/' | LC_COLLATE=C sort --ignore-case --numeric-sort | sed -E 's/^(.*)$/\1,/' | tr -d '\n' && echo

The ls command lists all files and directories in the current directory, including dot files and 
directories, in a single column (-1 option) without additional information (-A option).

The sed command extracts the file or directory name and appends a slash if the name ends with 
a directory (\/?$ matches an optional slash at the end of the line). The regular expression also
removes any non-alphanumeric characters at the beginning of the name (^([^0-9A-Za-z\/]*)) and captures the name and the
slash (if any) in two groups (([^0-9A-Za-z\/]*)(.*)(\/?)$).

The LC_COLLATE=C environment variable is used to sort the names in a case-insensitive and numeric
order, with digits coming before letters.

The second sed command adds a comma after each name and removes the trailing newline character (\n).
The tr command deletes the newline character and replaces it with a new line.
