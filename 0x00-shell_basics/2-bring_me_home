Without using any shell variable I can use a python script using 'os' module
Pytho script is:
import os
home_dir = os.path.expanduser("~")
os.chdir(home_dir)
print(f"Changed working directory to: {home_dir}")

The os.path.expanduser() function returns the user's home directory as an absolute path, 
and the os.chdir() function changes the working directory to the specified path. The resulting 
path is then printed using the print() function.

When you run this script, it will change the working directory to the user's 
home directory and print a message indicating that the directory has been 
changed. Note that the behavior of os.path.expanduser() may differ depending 
on the operating system, but it should work as expected on most Linux and Unix systems.
