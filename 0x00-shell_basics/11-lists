Here's a script that will list all files (including hidden ones) in the current
directory, the parent directory of the working directory, and the /boot 
directory in long format:

#!/bin/bash

# list files in current directory in long format
echo "Files in current directory:"
ls -al

# list files in parent directory of the working directory in long format
echo ""
echo "Files in parent directory:"
ls -al ../

# list files in /boot directory in long format
echo ""
echo "Files in /boot directory:"
ls -al /boot
