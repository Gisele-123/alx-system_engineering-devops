Here's a possible implementation of the script in bash:
#!/bin/bash

# Get the current working directory and its parent
cwd=$(pwd)
parent=$(dirname "$cwd")

# Copy HTML files from the current working directory to the parent directory
for file in *.html; do
  if [ ! -e "$parent/$file" ] || [ "$cwd/$file" -nt "$parent/$file" ]; then
    cp "$file" "$parent"
    echo "Copied $file to $parent"
  fi
done
